I enjoy solving daily coding challenges and since the whole COVID-19 situation started I have more time to do that because I am not commuting (WFH), meeting lots of people, etc.
In order to keep myself accountable, I have decided to share my solutions to the problems on a Github repo.


## 1. Array and string manipulation
* [Merging meeting times](./merging_meeting_times.py)
* [Reverse string in place](./reverse_string_in_place.py)
* [Reverse words](./reverse_words.py)
* [Merge sorted arrays](./merge_sorted_arrays.py)
* [Caf√® order checker](./cafe_order_checker.py)

## 2. Hashing and hash tables
* [Inflight entertainment](./inflight_entertainment.py)
* [Permutation palindrome](./permutation_palindrome.py)
